This project explores the legacy of Pino Ojeda, a prominent figure in Canarian art and literature, and brings her unfinished play Morir una sola vez to life through artificial intelligence. With the collaboration of specialists and Ojeda's family, the manuscript was completed, and an audio drama in podcast format was created, bringing her words to life with actors from Gran Canaria. This project, focused on cultural preservation, highlights AI's impact on art and brings literary heritage closer to new generations.
